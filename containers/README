Singularity build recipes for tooling related to Galactic Plane Monitoring

Built with:

sudo singularity build gpm_tools.img gpm_build.txt

Once built the container has all software packages required to process GPM data. 

External data dependencies related to the MWA primary beam are not packed within the container. Doing so would increase the container filesize considerably. 

The container include the 'mwa-reduce' software package, which is only available to the MWA collaboration.
